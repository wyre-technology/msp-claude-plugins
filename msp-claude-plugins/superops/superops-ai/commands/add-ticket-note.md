# Add SuperOps.ai Ticket Note

Add a note (internal or public) to an existing SuperOps.ai ticket for documentation and communication.

## Prerequisites

- Valid SuperOps.ai API token configured
- Ticket must exist in SuperOps.ai
- User must have ticket note permissions

## Steps

1. **Validate ticket exists**
   - Query ticket by ID or ticket number
   - Return error if ticket not found
   - Show current ticket subject for confirmation

2. **Determine note type**
   - Default to internal if not specified
   - Internal notes are only visible to technicians
   - Public notes are visible to the client/requester

3. **Check notification preference**
   - notify_customer only applies to public notes
   - If notify_customer is true and type is internal, warn user
   - Default is false (no notification)

4. **Add the note**
   ```graphql
   mutation addTicketNote($input: AddTicketNoteInput!) {
     addTicketNote(input: $input) {
       noteId
       content
       noteType
       createdTime
       createdBy {
         id
         name
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Variables:
   ```json
   {
     "input": {
       "ticketId": "<ticket_id>",
       "content": "<note>",
       "isPublic": false,
       "notifyCustomer": false
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Confirm note was added**
   - Display note ID
   - Show note preview
   - Confirm notification status

```

### Notification Warning

```
Warning: notify_customer is set to true but note type is internal.

```

### API Errors

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Invalid ticket ID | Verify ticket exists using /search-tickets |
| Note too long | Notes have a character limit; split into multiple notes |
| Permission denied | Check user permissions for this ticket |
| Ticket closed | Some workflows prevent notes on closed tickets |
| Rate limited | Wait and retry (800 req/min limit) |

## Best Practices

1. **Use internal notes for technical details** - Keep troubleshooting steps and technical info internal
2. **Keep public notes professional** - These are visible to clients
3. **Document thoroughly** - Future technicians will thank you
4. **Use notifications sparingly** - Don't spam customers with every update
5. **Include relevant context** - Reference KB articles, error codes, or related tickets
