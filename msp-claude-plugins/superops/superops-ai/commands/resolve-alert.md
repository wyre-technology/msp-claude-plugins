# Resolve SuperOps.ai Alert

Resolve an RMM alert and optionally create a ticket for documentation or follow-up.

## Prerequisites

- Valid SuperOps.ai API token configured
- Alert must exist and not already be resolved
- User must have alert management permissions
- RMM module enabled in SuperOps.ai

## Steps

1. **Validate alert exists**
   - Query alert by ID
   - Return error if alert not found
   - Show current alert details for confirmation

2. **Check alert status**
   - Can resolve from Active or Acknowledged status
   - Warn if already resolved
   - Show resolution history if exists

3. **Resolve the alert**
   ```graphql
   mutation resolveAlerts($input: ResolveAlertInput!) {
     resolveAlerts(input: $input) {
       alert {
         alertId
         status
         resolvedTime
         resolvedBy {
           id
           name
         }
         resolutionNotes
       }
       ticket {
         ticketId
         ticketNumber
         subject
       }
       errors {
         field
         message
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Variables:
   ```json
   {
     "input": {
       "alertIds": ["<alert_id>"],
       "resolutionNotes": "<resolution_note>",
       "createTicket": false,
       "ticketSubject": "<ticket_subject>"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Create ticket if requested**
   - If create_ticket is true, create linked ticket
   - Use ticket_subject or generate from alert message
   - Link ticket to alert and asset

5. **Confirm resolution**
   - Display updated alert status
   - Show ticket details if created
   - Confirm documentation is complete

### API Errors

| Error | Resolution |

| Invalid alert ID | Verify alert exists using /list-alerts |

## When to Create Tickets

Create a ticket when:
- Work was performed that should be billed
- Follow-up actions are needed
- Documentation is required for compliance
- The issue may recur and needs tracking
- Client communication is required

Skip ticket creation when:
- Alert auto-resolved (transient issue)
- No significant work was performed
- Issue was a false positive
- Monitoring threshold needs adjustment

## Best Practices

1. **Add resolution notes** - Document what was done
2. **Create tickets for significant work** - Track billable time
3. **Be specific** - Future technicians will thank you
4. **Review patterns** - Recurring alerts may need root cause analysis
5. **Verify resolution** - Confirm the issue is actually fixed
