    "notes": "Bulk acknowledgment - scheduled maintenance window"
  }
}
```

Alert not found: "alert_99999"

Please verify the alert ID is correct.
Use /list-alerts to find active alerts.
```

Alert ID: alert_9876
Status: Resolved

To reopen, the condition must trigger a new alert.

Contact your administrator to request access.
```

### API Errors

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Invalid alert ID | Verify alert exists using /list-alerts |

| Already resolved | Alert was resolved before acknowledgment |
| Permission denied | Check user permissions for alert management |
| Rate limited | Wait and retry (800 req/min limit) |

## Why Acknowledgment Matters

1. **Prevents duplicate work** - Other technicians see someone is handling it
2. **Improves visibility** - Management can see response times
3. **Tracks accountability** - Clear record of who is working on what
4. **Reduces alert fatigue** - Acknowledged alerts can be filtered out
5. **Supports SLAs** - Time to acknowledge is a key metric

## Best Practices

1. **Acknowledge quickly** - Even if you can't fix immediately
2. **Add meaningful notes** - Explain what you're investigating
3. **Follow up or escalate** - Don't let acknowledged alerts sit
4. **Create tickets for complex issues** - Track work properly
5. **Resolve when done** - Don't leave alerts in acknowledged state
