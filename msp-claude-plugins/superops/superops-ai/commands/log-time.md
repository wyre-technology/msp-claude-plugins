# Log Time on SuperOps.ai Ticket

Log a time entry against a SuperOps.ai ticket for billing and tracking purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Valid SuperOps.ai API token configured
- Ticket must exist in SuperOps.ai
- User must have time entry permissions

## Steps

1. **Validate ticket exists**
   - Query ticket by ID or ticket number
   - Return error if ticket not found
   - Show current ticket subject for confirmation

2. **Validate duration**
   - Must be a positive integer
   - Represents minutes (e.g., 30 = 30 minutes)
   - Warn if unusually long (> 480 minutes / 8 hours)

3. **Calculate start time**
   - If start_time not provided, calculate from now minus duration
   - Validate start_time is not in the future
   - Validate start_time is within reasonable range (not older than 30 days)

4. **Log the time entry**
   ```graphql
   mutation addTicketTimeEntry($input: AddTimeEntryInput!) {
     addTicketTimeEntry(input: $input) {
       timeEntryId
       ticketId
       duration
       description
       billable
       startTime
       endTime
       workType
       technician {
         id
         name
       }
       createdTime
     }
   }
   ```

   Variables:
   ```json
   {
     "input": {
       "ticketId": "<ticket_id>",

       "workType": "REMOTE_SUPPORT"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Confirm time entry was logged**
   - Display time entry ID
   - Show total time on ticket
   - Confirm billable status

## Error Handling

### Ticket Not Found

```
Ticket not found: "TICK-99999"

Please verify the ticket ID or number is correct.
Use /search-tickets to find the correct ticket.
```

### Invalid Duration

```
Invalid duration: "-30"

Duration must be a positive number of minutes.
Examples:
  30    = 30 minutes
  60    = 1 hour
  90    = 1.5 hours
```

### Duration Warning

```
Warning: Duration of 600 minutes (10 hours) is unusually long.

Are you sure this is correct?
- If working multiple days, consider logging separate entries per day
- Maximum recommended single entry: 480 minutes (8 hours)

Continue anyway? [y/N]
```

### Future Start Time

```
Invalid start time: Start time cannot be in the future.

Current time: 2026-02-04 14:00 UTC
Provided start: 2026-02-04 16:00 UTC

Please provide a past start time or omit to use current time.
```

### API Errors

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Invalid ticket ID | Verify ticket exists using /search-tickets |
| Invalid duration | Must be positive integer (minutes) |
| Invalid work type | Check available work types in SuperOps.ai |
| Permission denied | Check user permissions for time entry |
| Ticket closed | Some workflows prevent time on closed tickets |
| Rate limited | Wait and retry (800 req/min limit) |

## Best Practices

1. **Log time immediately** - Don't batch at end of day; you'll forget details
2. **Be descriptive** - Include what you did, not just how long
3. **Use correct work types** - Helps with reporting and billing
4. **Mark non-billable appropriately** - Internal work, training, etc.
5. **Log in smaller increments** - Multiple entries are better than one large one
6. **Round consistently** - Follow your organization's rounding policy
