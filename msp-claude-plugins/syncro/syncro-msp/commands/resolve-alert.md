## Tips

### Quick Resolution

For simple acknowledgments:

```
/resolve-alert 9876
```

### Documentation Best Practices

Always include a resolution note for audit trail:

```
/resolve-alert 9876 --resolution_note "Verified false positive - no action needed"
```

### Creating Tickets for Billing

If work was performed, create a ticket for time logging:

```
/resolve-alert 9876 --create_ticket true --resolution_note "Cleared temp files"
# Then log time
/log-time <ticket_id> 15 --notes "Disk cleanup"
```

### Batch Resolution Workflow

Review and resolve multiple alerts:

```
/list-alerts --severity Low
# Review each alert
/resolve-alert 9876 --resolution_note "Acknowledged"
/resolve-alert 9877 --resolution_note "Acknowledged"
```

### Auto-Generated Ticket Subject

If --ticket_subject is not provided, it defaults to:

```
"RMM Alert: <alert_type> - <asset_name>"
```

Example: "RMM Alert: Disk Space < 5% - ACME-DC01"
