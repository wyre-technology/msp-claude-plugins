## Tips

### Quick Status Updates

Use hidden comments for quick internal status updates:

```
/add-ticket-comment 12345 "Waiting for parts to arrive" --hidden true
```

### Customer Communication

Public comments automatically email the customer (unless --do_not_email):

```
/add-ticket-comment 12345 "Hi John, we've resolved the email issue. Please let us know if you experience any further problems."
```

### Documentation Best Practices

- Include timestamps for activities
- Reference specific error messages or logs
- Document troubleshooting steps taken
- Use hidden comments for sensitive internal notes
