## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid parameters | Check field values |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify API key |
| 404 | Invoice not found | Confirm invoice ID |
| 422 | Validation failed | Check required fields |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait and retry |

### Validation Errors

**"customer_id is required"** - Invoice must have a customer

**"date is required"** - Invoice must have a date

**"Cannot modify paid invoice"** - Void instead of editing

**"Payment exceeds balance"** - Check payment amount

## Best Practices

1. **Review before sending** - Check all line items for accuracy
2. **Set due dates** - Clear expectations for payment
3. **Use descriptive line items** - Customers understand charges
4. **Track partial payments** - Record as received
5. **Follow up promptly** - Address overdue invoices quickly
6. **Maintain documentation** - Keep payment references
7. **Reconcile regularly** - Match to bank records
8. **Use templates** - Consistent professional appearance
