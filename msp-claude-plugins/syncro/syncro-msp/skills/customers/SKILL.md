## API Patterns

### Creating a Customer

```http
POST /api/v1/customers
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

```json
{
  "business_name": "Acme Corporation",
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@acme.example.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567",
  "address": "123 Main Street",
  "city": "Springfield",
  "state": "IL",
  "zip": "62701",
  "notes": "Referred by ABC Company"
}
```

### Searching Customers

**Search by name:**
```http
GET /api/v1/customers?query=acme
```

**List all customers with pagination:**
```http
GET /api/v1/customers?page=1
```

**Filter by email:**
```http
GET /api/v1/customers?email=john.smith@acme.example.com
```

### Getting Customer Details

```http
GET /api/v1/customers/{id}
```

**Response includes:**
- Customer information
- Associated contacts
- Recent tickets
- Assets summary
- Invoice history

### Updating a Customer

```http
PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "phone": "555-987-6543",
  "notes": "Updated contact information per request"
}
```

### Creating a Contact

```http
POST /api/v1/contacts
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "customer_id": 12345,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@acme.example.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4568",
  "title": "IT Manager",
  "notes": "Primary technical contact"
}
```

### Searching Contacts

**Contacts for a customer:**
```http
GET /api/v1/contacts?customer_id=12345
```

**Search by email:**
```http
GET /api/v1/contacts?email=jane.doe@acme.example.com
```

### Updating a Contact

```http
PUT /api/v1/contacts/{id}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "title": "IT Director",
  "phone": "555-123-4569"
}
```

### Deleting a Contact

```http
DELETE /api/v1/contacts/{id}
```

## Common Workflows

### Client Onboarding

1. **Create customer record**
   - Enter business information
   - Set tax rate if applicable
   - Add referral source for tracking

2. **Create primary contact**
   - Add decision maker/main contact
   - Include email for communications
   - Note any preferences

3. **Add additional contacts**
   - Technical contacts
   - Billing contacts
   - Other stakeholders

4. **Set up assets**
   - Deploy RMM agent
   - Import existing inventory

5. **Create contract/agreement**
   - Define service terms
   - Set billing schedule

### Contact Management

1. **Verify before creating**
   - Search for existing contact by email
   - Check for duplicates

2. **Maintain accuracy**
   - Update titles when roles change
   - Archive contacts who leave
   - Add new contacts as needed

3. **Track relationships**
   - Note who can authorize work
   - Track technical vs billing contacts

### Customer Merge/Cleanup

When you discover duplicate customers:

1. **Identify the primary record** to keep
2. **Document assets** on both records
3. **Move tickets** to primary customer
4. **Update contacts** to point to primary
5. **Archive or delete** duplicate

## Response Examples

### Customer Object

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "id": 12345,
    "business_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@acme.example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567",
    "address": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "IL",
    "zip": "62701",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-02-10T14:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Contact Object

```json
{
  "contact": {
    "id": 67890,
    "customer_id": 12345,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@acme.example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4568",
    "mobile": "555-987-6543",
    "title": "IT Manager",
    "notes": "Primary technical contact",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid parameters | Check field values |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify API key |
| 404 | Customer not found | Confirm customer ID |
| 422 | Validation failed | Check required fields |
| 429 | Rate limited | Wait and retry |

### Validation Errors

**"business_name is required"** - Customer must have a name

**"Invalid email format"** - Check email address syntax

**"customer_id required"** - Contact must belong to a customer

## Best Practices

1. **Standardize naming** - Use consistent company name formats
2. **Verify before creating** - Always search first to prevent duplicates
3. **Complete profiles** - Fill in as much information as possible
4. **Keep contacts current** - Update when staff changes
5. **Use notes effectively** - Document important relationship details
6. **Track referrals** - Helps with marketing analysis
7. **Set appropriate tax rates** - Prevents billing errors
8. **Regular data cleanup** - Audit for duplicates periodically
