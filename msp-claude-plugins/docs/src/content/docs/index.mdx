Claude: Based on the impact (multiple users) and service affected (email),
        this should be HIGH priority. Let me create the ticket:

        /create-ticket "Acme Corp" "Email outage - multiple users affected"
        --priority 2 --description "Sales team (5 users) unable to access
        Outlook since 9am."
