   - Confirm ticket is accessible
   - Get current board ID for status validation

2. **Resolve field values to IDs**

   GET /service/priorities?conditions=name contains '{priority}'
   ```

   ```

   If subtype provided:
   ```http
   GET /service/boards/{boardId}/subtypes?conditions=name='{subtype}'
   ```

3. **Build patch payload**

   ]
   ```
