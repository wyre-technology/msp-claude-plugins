# Close ConnectWise PSA Ticket

Close a ConnectWise ticket with resolution notes and optional time entry.

## Prerequisites

- Valid ConnectWise PSA API credentials configured
- User must have ticket update permissions
- Ticket must exist and be accessible
- A valid closed status must exist on the ticket's board

## Steps

1. **Validate ticket exists and get current state**
   ```http
   GET /service/tickets/{id}
   ```
   - Confirm ticket is accessible
   - Get current board ID for status lookup
   - Check if ticket is already closed

2. **Resolve closed status**
   ```http
   GET /service/boards/{boardId}/statuses?conditions=closedStatus=true
   ```
   - If status parameter provided, validate it's a closed status
   - Otherwise, use board's default closed status

3. **Add resolution note**
   ```http
   POST /service/tickets/{id}/notes
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "text": "<resolution>",
     "resolutionFlag": true,
     "internalAnalysisFlag": false,
     "customerUpdatedFlag": true,
     "processNotifications": true
   }
   ```

4. **Log time entry (if time_minutes provided)**
   ```http
   POST /time/entries
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "chargeToId": <ticket_id>,
     "chargeToType": "ServiceTicket",
     "timeStart": "<current_datetime>",
     "timeEnd": "<current_datetime + time_minutes>",
     "actualHours": <time_minutes / 60>,
     "notes": "<time_notes or resolution>",
     "billableOption": "<Billable or DoNotBill>"
   }
   ```

5. **Update ticket status to closed**
   ```http
   PATCH /service/tickets/{id}
   Content-Type: application/json

   [
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/status/id", "value": <closed_status_id>},
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/resolution", "value": "<resolution>"}
   ]
   ```

6. **Return closure confirmation**
