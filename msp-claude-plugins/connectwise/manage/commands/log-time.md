# Log Time to ConnectWise PSA Ticket

Log a time entry against a ConnectWise ticket.

## Prerequisites

- Valid ConnectWise PSA API credentials configured
- User must have time entry creation permissions
- Ticket must exist and be accessible

## Steps

1. **Validate ticket exists**
   ```http
   GET /service/tickets/{id}
   ```
   - Confirm ticket is accessible
   - Get company ID for agreement lookup
   - Note if ticket is closed (warn user)

2. **Resolve work type (if provided)**
   ```http
   GET /time/workTypes?conditions=name='{work_type}'
   ```

3. **Resolve work role (if provided)**
   ```http
   GET /time/workRoles?conditions=name='{work_role}'
   ```

4. **Calculate time values**
   - If `actual_hours` provided, calculate `time_end` from `time_start`
   - If `time_end` provided, calculate `actual_hours` from difference
   - Validate times are logical (end > start)

5. **Check agreement coverage (if billable)**
   ```http
   GET /finance/agreements?conditions=company/id={companyId} and cancelledFlag=false
   ```
   - Warn if no active agreement
   - Show remaining hours if block agreement

6. **Create time entry**
   ```http
   POST /time/entries
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "chargeToId": <ticket_id>,
     "chargeToType": "ServiceTicket",
     "member": {"identifier": "<current_user>"},
     "timeStart": "<time_start>",
     "timeEnd": "<time_end>",
     "actualHours": <actual_hours>,
     "notes": "<notes>",
     "billableOption": "<billable>",
     "workType": {"id": <work_type_id>},
     "workRole": {"id": <work_role_id>}
   }
   ```

7. **Return confirmation with totals**
