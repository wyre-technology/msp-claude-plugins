     "resolutionFlag": false,
     "customerUpdatedFlag": <true if flag=external or both>,
     "processNotifications": true
   }
   ```

4. **For ticket field updates - Patch the ticket**
   ```http
   PATCH /service/tickets/{id}
   Content-Type: application/json

     {"op": "replace", "path": "/internalAnalysis", "value": "<text>"},
